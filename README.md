# cbattle
a little minecraft minigame :)

Uses an inventory GUI to allow players to join player-hosted groups and start a CaveBattle game.

Spawns a massive cube surrounded with bedrock.

All players spawn within a space in the cube. Players are given a super-pickaxe, tnt, lighter and several combat items.
On kill, the player will spawn in a random spot.
Half way through, a wither will spawn.
The player with the most kills wins the game.
